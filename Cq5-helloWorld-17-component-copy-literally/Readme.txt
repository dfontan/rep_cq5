CQ5 AND LITERALLY COMPONENT COPY

If you want to copy some component you can do it literally.
It means you can get folder with this component, put it
in your project and make necessary changes.

For instance if you want to copy some default component of Geometrixx 
then create package with content: "libs/fundation/component/<copied_compnent>".
Then copy this component to your project and make changes.
