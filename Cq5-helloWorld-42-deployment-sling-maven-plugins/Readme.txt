CQ5 AND TWO MODULES TOGETHER: 'MAVEN SLING PLUGIN' AND 'CONTENT PACKAGE MAVEN PLUGIN'





This project shows how to join together two maven plugins:
- Maven Sling Plugin: this plugin is used to create bundle - jar package with services for OSGi;
- Content Package Maven Plugin: this plugin is used to create zip package with componetns.
	Using these two plugins together user can deploy all necessery elements for creating
CQ web application.



Attention!!!
Modules were extracted from parent folder because some Windows 7 problems (path to commit can not be
longer then 255 ). Thats why before runnig project user has to move modules again into parent folder.
